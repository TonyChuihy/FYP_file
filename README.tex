\subsection{Benchmark Problems}

We significantly expand the evaluation scope through five diverse LP problem classes:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Independent Set (Indset)}: Maximum weight independent set problems with approximately 1000 variables and constraints
    \item \textbf{Set Cover}: Classical set covering problems with approximately 700 variables and constraints  
    \item \textbf{Facility Location}: Uncapacitated facility location problems with approximately 900 variables and constraints
    \item \textbf{Combinatorial Auctions (Cauction)}: Winner determination problems with approximately 500-600 variables and constraints
    \item \textbf{Random LPs (Hrandom)}: Randomly generated problems (500×500) with high constraint density = 0.9
\end{itemize}

This diverse collection enables rigorous assessment of generalization across different combinatorial structures and random instances.
